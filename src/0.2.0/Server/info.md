This server allows for IPV4 connections on the port 2222, by default.

This server uses the majority of the code for the application. 
Even though both the client and server have the original code in side, the server is the main one to access those classes.

The idea is for the clients to be more then just a shell text command prompt.  The hope is for the client to contain more when the GUI
is implemented.
